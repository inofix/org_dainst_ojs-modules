This is a collection of patches and plugins for our OJS service at the DAI.


= Why? =

We love diff/patch.

As it is a PHP project and the changes will probably not be too many -
mostly for adopting OJS to the customers needs, and without
major impact for the community, it seems the easiest solution to run
diff and patch..

If we should see a possibility to commit something to upstream here,
a patch would anyway not be the most stupid format (upstream uses
those too btw.)..

It is suggested to use separate diffs for each task or scope, i.e. the 
changes in the theme might all be collected in one patch, while the
addition of a separate URL for the PDFs in RSS/atom might be better
separated in a distinct patch..

In case one patch should depend on another one, please put a file
called DEPENDENCIES into the subfolder and specify the name of the
patch(es) to be applied first.

Whole plugins (inside the plugins dir) are just added as dirs and files.


= How? =

Download the original OJS (e.g. ojs-2.4.5) you need to patch to your
local directory (here called `parentdir) and unpack it twice
so you get two identical copies, e.g. `ojs-2.4.5.orig and
ojs-2.4.5.new`.

Apply then all the other patches needed to both copies, so
that the later changes will not contain already mapped fixes.

(Obviously you might also decide to unpack the archive only once,
apply the patches first to the unpacked archive and copy it with
e.g. `cp -a` only then, in order to achieve the same result..)

Now you can alter the second copy to your wishes.

For the creation of the patch, start `diff` from the parent directory
and do not care how that is actually called, issue the command something
like so:

{{{
me@home:parentdir$ diff -Naur ojs-2.4.5.orig ojs-2.4.5.new
}}}

Later for applying the patch on the server suite, we will ignore
the top directory and apply the patch like this:

{{{
server:ojs# patch -p1 < /home/me/ojs-2.4.X-org_dainst-theme.patch
}}}

All done. Congrats! Please remember to let the remote git repo know
of your labour.. ;)
